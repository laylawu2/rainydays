# Rainy Days

Save pictures, thoughts and quotes that'll lift your spirit and get ready for the rainy days! RainyDays is created during a post-election hackthon event at Fullstack Academy of Code in NYC.

## Technology

RainyDays is written in Javascript. My partner Kat and I utilized React's framework in conjunction with Redux.js, React Router, Material UI, CSS3 and HTML5 for front end development. We decided to use firebase, a NoSQL database hosted by Google, for efficient and scalable data management and real-time updates across user devices.

## Plan

We plan on continue developing Rainy Days into a Chrome Extension.
